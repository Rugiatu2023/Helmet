<p>Animatronic Lion Helmet Portfolio</p>
<p>Introduction</p>
<p>This portfolio presents the collaborative effort by Team A to design, develop, and construct an animatronic lion helmet with motorized eyelid . This assignment reflects how physical and virtual prototyping techniques were applied within a structured product development process to create a tangible artefact. The helmet serves as a wearable model combining visual design, mechanical movement, and iterative physical testing. The goal was to produce a lightweight, realistic lion-themed helmet that incorporated animated blinking eyelids using servo mechanisms. Our final artefact represents the culmination of weeks of planning, 3D modelling, test printing, mechanical assembly, and aesthetic refinement. The project was delivered within budget constraints and against a strict academic timeline, helping all team members improve technical and collaborative skills in a real-world engineering context</p>
<p>Reflective Narrative of Product Development</p>
<p>Concept and Planning</p>
<p>In the early weeks of the semester, our team discussed ideas that could effectively combine robotics and physical artefacts. We drew inspiration from theatre props, theme park animatronics, and animal-themed wearable costumes. After considering several designs, the lion head stood out due to its recognizable features and the potential to integrate animated eyelids as a core moving part. The concept was refined during collaborative sketching and online brainstorming sessions. We created a MoSCoW chart to categories essential and optional features. Tasks were then distributed among group members based on skills in modelling, electronics, research, and assembly. This ensured everyone had a clear role, and accountability was maintained throughout the process. We used a Gantt chart to schedule activities across the semester. Initial weeks were allocated to design and modelling, followed by test printing, full-scale fabrication, mechanical integration, and visual finishing. Each phase was reviewed as a group, with adjustments made to timelines based on print errors, material availability, and workshop time.</p>
<h2>&nbsp;</h2>
<h2>3D Modelling and Virtual Prototype</h2>
<p>Blender was selected as our 3D modelling program due to its powerful sculpting tools, animation support, and open-source availability. A single group member was tasked with the lion helmet base creation. The model was sculpted with exacting measurements to fit a human head and included anatomically correct features such as a snout, eye sockets, and a stylized mane. The eyelids were created as separate movable components. We used Blender's animation timeline to simulate how the eyelids would close and open, which helped us decide how much space to leave between servo mounting and hinge articulation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When we were satisfied, we exported STLs for the helmet, eyelids, and test rigs. These were examined multiple times to improve mesh quality and printability.</p>
<p>3D Printing and Assembly</p>
<p>Cura was used for pre-processing of STL files for 3D printing. Layer height, infill density, and support generation were modified as per the complexity of the geometry. As the helmet was larger than the build volume of the printer, the helmet was divided into three separate sections, which were later assembled with epoxy glue. Printing was done with PLA filament, as it was economical and easy to handle. Post-processing involved sanding off rough edges and filling to smooth seams. Adjustable straps and foam padding were included to improve comfort and functionality</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mechanical Design &ndash; Eyelid Mechanism</p>
<p>The eyelid mechanism was one of the most complex parts of the build. Initially, we explored using an Arduino to control servo motors, but due to time constraints and the project&rsquo;s physical focus, we used a servo tester module instead. Servos were mounted on internal brackets, and mechanical linkages were designed to raise and lower the eyelids through rotation. Hinges allowed the eyelids to pivot naturally, and springs helped restore their position after actuation. We tested several materials for hinges and linkages before settling on lightweight plastic joints. While programming could have enabled automated blinking, manual control allowed for quicker iterations and helped demonstrate motion without the complexity of coding.</p>

<p>Aesthetic appeal was vital to the success of the helmet. We applied multiple coats of acrylic spray paint to mimic lion fur tones&mdash;golden brown and sandy yellow. Protective coatings were added to prevent chipping and UV damage. For texture, we considered applying flocking or faux fur patches. LED strips were optionally added around the eye socket to highlight motion during dim lighting. The group sourced and tested various materials for visual enhancement. Reflective tape was used in some versions to simulate eye shine. These enhancements significantly improved the helmet&rsquo;s presentation value and visibility in a.</p>
<p>demonstration setting.</p>

<p>Testing and Final Adjustments</p>
<p>Each team member planned to wore the helmet and operated the eyelid mechanism, because of time we did not ,only one member did. Feedback was gathered on comfort, balance, and visual appeal. Some issues included pressure points at the forehead and misaligned servos. We added extra foam padding and adjusted the linkages accordingly. The final prototype was successfully demonstrated to peers and instructors. It fulfilled the goals of mechanical movement, wearability, and realistic aesthetics. Each team member contributed to documentation and visual media for final presentation.</p>

<p>Critical Evaluation of Methods</p>
<p>During the project, we analyzed critically a number of techniques&mdash;a few of which were implemented, and some which we rejected after evaluating their viability.</p>
<p>Methods Used</p>
<p>Blender was used for 3D modeling due to free access, interactive sculpting capabilities, and easy rendering of virtual animations. Blender supported our requirement to virtually animate eye-lid movement prior to printing. Slicing software in Cura allowed finely tuned control of print parameters. PLA filament was used due to ease of printing, safety, and affordability. Hand control of servo motors, although simpler than Arduino programming of them, allowed for immediate mechanical demonstration without debugging code.</p>
<p>Methods Evaluated But Not Implemented</p>
<p>Arduino programming was planned initially but postponed because of time. Manual servo testers sufficed instead. Fusion 360 was researched for parametric modeling but Blender was found to offer freer organic modeling for a lion head. Resin/printing was considered for a high level of detail but ruled out because of toxicity, added cost, and limited build volume. Laser cutting was unnecessary because the helmet model was ideal for additive manufacturing.</p>
<p>Industrial Setting and Appropriateness</p>
<p>The tools and techniques used in this project&mdash;Blender, PLA printing, and hand testing&mdash;are excellent for rapid prototyping and instructional use. For commercial use, more durable materials such as ABS or PETG would be utilized. Servo motion could be complemented with digital control for automatic repeated cycles, especially in commercial animatronics. The model can be scaled up for theatre or exhibition use with advanced actuation, sound, and even face detection for interaction. Ecologically, PLA is biodegradable, making it a suitable material for temporary structures.</p>

<p><strong>Overall&nbsp;Considerations&nbsp;and&nbsp;Observations on&nbsp;Team&nbsp;Working<br /> </strong>Our team composition consisted of&nbsp;members&nbsp;with diverse backgrounds and&nbsp;different&nbsp;experience&nbsp;levels&nbsp;in&nbsp;both&nbsp;physical&nbsp;prototyping&nbsp;and&nbsp;digital&nbsp;modeling. We&nbsp;utilized&nbsp;this diversity by&nbsp;delegating&nbsp;roles&nbsp;to&nbsp;match the skill sets of&nbsp;each member;&nbsp;one&nbsp;led&nbsp;the&nbsp;Blender sculpting, another&nbsp;was&nbsp;responsible for&nbsp;Cura slicing and print&nbsp;monitoring,&nbsp;and&nbsp;other&nbsp;members&nbsp;were in charge of&nbsp;hardware integration and documentation.&nbsp;There were&nbsp;weekly&nbsp;meetings&nbsp;to&nbsp;monitor&nbsp;progress,&nbsp;enable&nbsp;peer&nbsp;review, and&nbsp;redistribute&nbsp;tasks&nbsp;accordingly. These&nbsp;group&nbsp;check-ins&nbsp;helped&nbsp;to&nbsp;enhance&nbsp;our group dynamics&nbsp;significantly&nbsp;and ensured&nbsp;no&nbsp;work&nbsp;was left behind or repeated unnecessarily.<br /> During the Blender modelling, our 3D modeller&nbsp;was&nbsp;having&nbsp;difficulty&nbsp;in&nbsp;attaining&nbsp;symmetry and realism in the lion's facial structure.&nbsp;Everyone&nbsp;collaborated&nbsp;on&nbsp;researching&nbsp;online sculpting tutorials and&nbsp;observing&nbsp;reference&nbsp;images&nbsp;for&nbsp;added&nbsp;accuracy. This was a&nbsp;valuable&nbsp;example of problem-solving and peer learning&nbsp;being&nbsp;practiced.<br /> When&nbsp;the STL files were&nbsp;complete,&nbsp;the&nbsp;print technician initiated&nbsp;initial&nbsp;printing&nbsp;tests&nbsp;to determine&nbsp;the&nbsp;best&nbsp;printing&nbsp;orientation. This&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;for&nbsp;discoveries&nbsp;regarding&nbsp;bed adhesion,&nbsp;warping&nbsp;of layers, and temperature&nbsp;calibration. Failures were not&nbsp;viewed&nbsp;as&nbsp;barriers&nbsp;but rather&nbsp;as&nbsp;learning opportunities.&nbsp;The&nbsp;iterations were&nbsp;thoroughly&nbsp;documented&nbsp;via&nbsp;photographs&nbsp;and notes, which later&nbsp;became&nbsp;central&nbsp;to&nbsp;our reflective&nbsp;evaluation.&nbsp;We&nbsp;worked&nbsp;together&nbsp;face-to-face&nbsp;and&nbsp;via&nbsp;digital&nbsp;means using&nbsp;shared folders and checklists&nbsp;to&nbsp;allow for&nbsp;asynchronous&nbsp;engagement, particularly during&nbsp;intense&nbsp;academic periods.</p>
<h1>&nbsp;</h1>
<p>Detailed Project Appraisal and Lessons Learned</p>
<p>In retrospect, one of our project's greatest strengths was our capacity for iteration. Every phase modeling, printing, building was tested and refined according to issues discovered. This process of iterative refinement enabled the creation of a high-quality final product. For instance, an early prototype of the eyelid had restricted motion because of faulty hinge placement. Rather than scrapping the idea, we disassembled the test assembly, reworked the joint spacing, and proceeded with further trials. This attitude of accepting failure for betterment was essential.</p>
<p>Also, the choice to omit Arduino programming though at first perceived as a sacrifice&mdash;turned out to be a blessing. It saved us time and enabled us to concentrate on mechanical accuracy. In the future, we can envision how the introduction of a microcontroller could pave the way for more complicated animations or sensor-driven reactions.</p>
<p>Budgeting was also a valuable learning experience. Certain items (like high-priced servos or industrial adhesives) were beyond our means. We balanced alternatives on the basis of supplier specifications, reviews, and compatibility with PLA components. This enabled us to make educated compromises a key element of engineering practice.</p>
<p>We also realized the value of aesthetics in the determination of perceived functionality. Even though our servo movement was manually triggered, onlookers reacted positively to the realism of the helmet, which was augmented by painting, texturing, and lighted eye details. This observation reaffirmed the central role of visual design in robotics and animatronics.</p>
<p>Prospective Improvements and Recommendations</p>
<p>With additional time and budget, several enhancements can be made. Firstly, incorporating Arduino or Raspberry Pi along with servo drivers would enable synchronized eyelid animation using timers or audio inputs. These enhancements would ensure that the helmet is more interactive and engaging.</p>
<p>Secondly, weight reduction could be achieved by printing thinner walls or using a material like PETG or ABS, where reduced infill is achievable without any loss of structural integrity. Alternatively, the inner helmet could be omitted and replaced with a modular foam cap for enhanced comfort.</p>
<p>Mechanically, the servo mounting brackets could be improved by using reinforced PETG or precision-machined parts to reduce the risk of displacement while in use. Additionally, the inclusion of a cover panel inside the helmet would help to protect the electronic parts and keep the wiring tidy.</p>
<p>Visually, textures of hand painting or fur coating using faux leather or fleece could improve the helmet. Flocking spray, although considered, was avoided due to workshop constraints but could be another option for visual realism improvement. A sound module to replicate roaring or breathing may also be added for stage purposes.</p>
<p>Planning Tools: MoSCoW Prioritization and Task Management</p>
<p>Early in the project, we employed MoSCoW prioritization to effectively control expectations for features. This model enabled us to prioritize the most critical things, such as a wearable form factor and functional eyelid movement, while keeping the nice-to-have enhancements such as audio effects or wireless functionality in check. The following categorization indicates how the model assisted in determining the scope of the project:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Must-Have: Functional wearable helmet; Servo-actuated eyelid movement; Basic aesthetic finishing; Comfort and safety features. Should-Have: Removable foam liner; LED visual enhancement; Access to internal components. Could Have: Audio integration; Voice-activated eyelid movement; Full-body costume. Excluded: Facial recognition software; Sensors for real-time tracking; Mobile app interface.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This approach was especially useful in group meetings on allocating time for additional features vs. simplifying core aspects. It enabled team cohesion around deliverables while fostering creative thinking in subsequent stages.</p>
<p><strong>Material Sourcing and Sustainability Considerations</strong></p>
<p>The material selection was both functional and environmental. PLA filament was selected due to its availability and high print quality, coupled with its degradability when compared to petroleum-based filaments. We purchased PLA from local suppliers to reduce shipping emissions, and failed prints were stored for possible recycling or remelting. Spray paints and adhesives were selected from low-VOC (volatile organic compound) options where possible to reduce toxicity and indoor air impact upon application. Even though the servos and electronics were sourced from global suppliers, we evaluated suppliers based on their delivery schedules and packaging waste generated. Tools such as screwdrivers, sanders, and paint masks were recycled from past coursework and shared among group members to avoid costs and ensure sustainability.</p>
<p><strong>Personal Learning Outcomes and Team Development</strong></p>
<p>This project helped all group members achieve greater insight in practical engineering, digital fabrication, and project delivery. The following are reflections with key skills learned by each member :3D Model Learned complex sculpting techniques in Blender, mesh cleaning for 3D print readiness, and keyframe animation of mechanical movement. Hardware Assembler: Developed confidence in servo alignment, mechanical linkages, wiring management, and troubleshooting of physical testing. Documentation Coordinator: Developed technical writing skills in formal settings, Word formatting, the generation of Gantt charts, and source control management of portfolio material. Visual Designer: Implemented surface finishing techniques, tested paint gradients, and researched eco-friendly paint alternatives. We all enhanced our skills to work together in terms of time management, communication when working remotely, and giving feedback. This included using cloud storage, Gantt charts, and checklist to divide work fairly and avoid duplication.</p>
<p>Summary and Final Thoughts</p>
<p>The Animatronic Lion Helmet project was a comprehensive and rewarding experience that allowed our group to synthesis theory and practice. From modelling to final testing, each phase was iterative and reflected authentic engineering development. The decision to focus on mechanical prototyping rather than programming paid off, as we delivered a visually compelling and operationally functional artefact. Looking forward, the lessons learned in this project can directly inform future coursework, internships, and industry applications in areas such as prosthetics, props, educational robotics, or wearable tech design.</p>
<p><strong>Gantt Chart Reflection and Weekly Development Summary</strong></p>
<p>Our Gantt chart was a dynamic planning tool that visualized each phase of the project and allowed us to reallocate time when tasks overran. The initial plan assumed that small-scale test prints would be completed within one week, but after encountering printer calibration issues and PLA warping, we extended this by three days. Likewise, servo mechanism testing took longer than planned due to repositioning the eyelid brackets multiple times.</p>
<p>Despite these delays, the Gantt chart helped us balance parallel workflows. While one member focused on redesigning eyelid hinges, others completed painting and visual styling, ensuring no downtime. We used color coding to distinguish between design, hardware, aesthetics, and review. Breaks and holidays were clearly marked to avoid scheduling errors during the Easter break.</p>
